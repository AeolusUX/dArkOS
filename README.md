The overarching goals of dArkOS is as follows:
1. Highly customizable 
1. Performance
1. Online Updates (Won't require SD card reflashing unless there are major structural changes like file system changes.)
1. Enthusiats focused

This is intended to continue to the work from [ArkOS]() but in a way that allows others to easily fork and modify the OS to their own taste.  If there's a feature not currently available that you want, you can fork this and add it yourself.
Don't feel like building the OS from scratch or don't have the resources to do so?  Ok, just download one of the available prebuilt images and make changes right in the OS.  Since this OS is based on the latest stable version of Debian, you have
access to over 64,000 packages you can install via the Debian Advanced Package Tool (APT).  Want to build the latest testing or bleeding edge release of Debian? See the notes below on how to accomplish this.

**Building instructions:**
   - Suggested Environment - Ubuntu or related variants, version 24.04 or newer \
     Because chroot is used in this process, heavy use of sudo is made.  To reduce the possibility of priviledge issues, \
     it's best to be able to execute sudo without needing a password.  This can be done using one of the 2 methods below.
      - Method 1: - Open a Terminal window and type `sudo visudo` \
                    In the bottom of the file, add the following line: `$USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL` \
                    Where $USER is your username on your system. Save and close the sudoers file (if you haven't changed your \
                    default terminal editor (you'll know if you have), press Ctl + x to exit nano and it'll prompt you to save).
      - Method 2: - Clone this git repo then run `./FreeSudo.sh`.  If there were no errors, it should've completed this change for you. \
                    You can verify this by checking if a `/etc/sudoers.d/$USER` file exists and contains `$USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL` in it.
     
Now you should be able to just run make <device_name> to build for a supported device.  Example: `make rg353m`

**Notes**
- To build on a different release of Debian, change the DEBIAN_CODE_NAME export in the Makefile.  Other debian code names can be found at https://www.debian.org/releases/
- Initial build time on an Intel I7-8700U unit with a 512GB NVME SSD and 32GB of DDR4 memory is a little over 19 hours.  Subsequent builds are about 8 hours thanks to ccache.
